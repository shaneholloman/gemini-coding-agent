Remember we are using the new `google.genai` SDK for this project and **NOT** the old `google.generativeai` SDK which is deprecated. If needed, you can do a web search for the docs here: https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/index.html or you may be able to find documentation snippets in the local `reference_code_examples/genaisdk` folder in this project.
