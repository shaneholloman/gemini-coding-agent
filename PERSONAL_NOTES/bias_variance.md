Here's a brief and elegant explanation of bias and variance in machine learning:

*   **Bias:** How far off the model's *average* prediction is from the true value. High bias means the model is too simple and misses the underlying patterns (underfitting).
*   **Variance:** How much the model's prediction for a *given* data point varies if trained on different datasets. High variance means the model is too complex and sensitive to the specific training data (overfitting).

Think of it like aiming at a target:
*   High Bias, Low Variance: Shots are consistently off-target but clustered together.
*   Low Bias, High Variance: Shots are scattered widely but centered around the target.
*   Low Bias, Low Variance: Shots are clustered tightly around the bullseye.

The goal is to find a balance (the bias-variance tradeoff) to minimize total error.
