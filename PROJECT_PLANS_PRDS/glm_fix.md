**Investigating token error**

It seems like there’s an error when trying to count tokens — specifically that the system expects each part in the conversation to have a text field or something else, like a file with a URI or mime type. The issue may be because some parts are missing text. Maybe the conversation history includes `uploaded_file` objects without proper fields. I’ll search the file to see if there’s an issue with how conversation history is built or stored. Need to adjust the code to ensure no empty parts are there!

**Troubleshooting file attributes in conversation history**

The error points to missing file attributes (uri and mime\_type) in certain parts of conversation history. The issue seems to arise when the code tries to build new Content objects with text but ends up passing file data from model responses. The conversation history might inadvertently include file parts, even if the code was changed to pass only text. I’ll need to check the initialization process (`_initialize_chat`) to see if text is being correctly split from file parts, potentially causing the issue.

**Fixing type mismatch in conversation history**

It looks like the error might be due to mixing `glm.Part` and `types.Part` from different libraries. The conversation history should only include `types.Part` from the genai SDK, but the code currently uses `glm.Part` which doesn't align properly, causing issues with token counting. To fix this, I need to replace `glm.Part` and `glm.Content` with `types.Part` and `types.Content` throughout the code. I'll also remove the wrong import and adjust how history is serialized and loaded.


Thought for 51 seconds


**Root cause**

`self.client.models.count_tokens()` expects every element in `contents` to be a `genai.types.Content` object whose `.parts` are `genai.types.Part` objects (or plain strings).
In the recent patch you silently switched to the **wrong** class hierarchy:

```python
import google.ai.generativelanguage as glm      # ← from the *legacy* PaLM SDK
...
new_user_content = glm.Content(parts=[glm.Part(text=...)], role="user")
```

`glm.Part` is *not* the same type as `genai.types.Part`; when the GenAI SDK’s internal transformer tries to serialise it, it finds the `file_data` field it uses for file‑parts, sees that required sub‑fields (`uri`, `mime_type`) are missing, and raises

```
ValueError: file uri and mime_type are required.
```

**What to change**

The two occurrences introduced by the diff are visible at:

* import statement 
* first manual append of a user message 

After reverting to the correct `genai.types.*` classes (or simply passing plain strings, which the SDK will coerce), the transformer no longer looks for a `file_data` stanza and `count_tokens()` works.

**Minimal patch (gist)**

```diff
-from google.ai.generativelanguage import Content as GContent, Part as GPart
+from google.genai import types

-# when you log a user message
-new_user_content = GContent(role="user", parts=[GPart(text=message_to_send)])
+new_user_content = types.Content(role="user",
+                                 parts=[types.Part(text=message_to_send)])

-# when you log the model reply
-history_agent_content = GContent(role="model",
-                                 parts=[GPart(text=agent_response_text)])
+history_agent_content = types.Content(role="model",
+                                      parts=[types.Part(text=agent_response_text)])

# /load handler (same idea)
parts = [types.Part(text=t) for t in item['parts']]
content = types.Content(role=item['role'], parts=parts)
```

Remove the stray `glm` import and let your editor/linter flag any remaining `glm.` references.

**Sanity‑check after the fix**

```python
token_count_response = client.models.count_tokens(
        model=model_name,
        contents=conversation_history  # should now be OK
)
print(token_count_response.total_tokens)
```

If you still see an error, print the *types* of every `content.parts[0]` to ensure they are either `genai.types.Part` or `str`; nothing else should appear.

**Side note**

If at some point you really need the lower‑level PaLM/GLM types (e.g. for Vertex AI streaming), keep them in a different namespace and never mix them into objects handed to `google.genai`.
