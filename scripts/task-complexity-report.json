      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "This task is already broken down into 8 subtasks. If generating anew, generate 8 subtasks for 'Design and Implement `/edit_history` Command' covering: command syntax design (replace, delete, list with index), command parsing, core logic for entry replacement, core logic for entry deletion, indexed history display, robust error handling, confirmation prompt for deletion, and command registration with comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to design choices for editing mechanisms, complex parsing for various operations and arguments, direct manipulation of critical data (conversation history) with risk of corruption, need for robust error handling for invalid inputs/indices, and user safety considerations like confirmation prompts for destructive actions. The existing 8 subtasks reflect this depth."

      "reasoning": "Involves managing a global application state, interacting with a standard library (Python logging) to change its behavior dynamically, and ensuring user feedback. Potentially requires updates to existing log statements if not already conditional."

      "reasoning": "High complexity due to its research nature involving cutting-edge LLM techniques (structured output generation), prompt engineering, potential integration of new and complex libraries (DSPy, Instructor), and the experimental aspect of a POC aiming to improve search relevance. The core challenge is reliably guiding an LLM."
