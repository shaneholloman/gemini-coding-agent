# Task ID: 2
# Title: Design and Implement `/edit_history` Command
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement `/edit_history` to allow users to modify conversation history entries by index (replace content or delete entry).
# Details:
Decide on and implement an editing mechanism. Recommended: index-based commands like `/edit_history <index> "new content"` (to replace message content) and `/edit_history delete <index>` (to delete an entry). Implement parsing for these commands and logic to modify the `self.conversation_history` list. Include robust error handling for invalid indices, malformed commands, or unintended consequences of edits. Register in `slashcommands.py`. Consider safety against data corruption. The primary target for editing is the 'content' of a message; role should typically remain unchanged.

# Test Strategy:
1. Populate history with 3-5 entries. 2. Test `/edit_history <valid_index> "new message content"`: verify the specific entry's content is updated. 3. Test `/edit_history delete <valid_index>`: verify entry is removed and history list adjusts. 4. Test with out-of-bounds indices for both operations. 5. Test with malformed commands (e.g., missing index, missing content for edit). 6. Ensure informative error messages are displayed for all error conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Command Syntax and User Interaction Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the precise command structure for listing history, replacing content (e.g., `/edit_history <index> "new content"`), and deleting entries (e.g., `/edit_history delete <index>`). Outline how users will view history to obtain the correct index for editing.
### Details:
Consider 1-based vs 0-based indexing for user input and clearly communicate the chosen convention. Specify handling of quoted multi-word content and potential subcommands for clarity (e.g., `list`, `replace`, `delete`).

## 2. Implement History Display with Indexing [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement functionality for the `/edit_history` command (e.g., when called without modification arguments or via a specific subcommand like `/edit_history list`) to display the conversation history. Each entry must have a clear, user-friendly (e.g., 1-based) index.
### Details:
Output format should be easy to read in a CLI. Consider displaying a snippet of each history entry alongside its index. Ensure consistent indexing presentation to the user.

## 3. Implement Command Parsing Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop the parser to correctly interpret the `/edit_history` command, distinguishing between list, replace, and delete operations. Extract parameters like index, new content (if applicable), and operation type based on the designed syntax.
### Details:
Handle variations in spacing and ensure robust extraction of quoted strings for new content. Convert user-facing index (e.g., 1-based) to internal (e.g., 0-based) index during parsing.

## 4. Implement Core Logic for History Replacement [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Implement the functionality to modify `self.conversation_history` by replacing an entry at a specified internal index with new content. This involves updating the existing list structure.
### Details:
Ensure the `self.conversation_history` list is correctly updated. Handle the storage of the new content, potentially overwriting or modifying the existing entry object/structure.

## 5. Implement Core Logic for History Deletion [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Implement the functionality to modify `self.conversation_history` by deleting an entry at a specified internal index. This involves removing an element from the list.
### Details:
Ensure the correct element is removed from `self.conversation_history`. Be mindful of list index changes if multiple operations are performed sequentially without re-fetching indices.

## 6. Implement Robust Error Handling and User Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling for scenarios like invalid index (out of bounds, non-numeric, non-integer), malformed command syntax, or missing arguments. Provide clear, informative feedback messages to the user for both successful operations and errors.
### Details:
Error messages should guide the user on how to correct the command (e.g., 'Invalid index. Please use a number between 1 and N.'). Success messages should confirm the action (e.g., 'Entry 5 replaced.', 'Entry 3 deleted.').

## 7. Add Confirmation Prompt for Destructive Operations (Deletion) [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.5
### Description: For deletion operations, implement an interactive confirmation prompt (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete entry X: '[snippet of content]'? [y/N]") to prevent accidental data loss, enhancing user safety.
### Details:
The prompt should clearly indicate which entry is targeted, possibly showing a snippet of its content. Only proceed with deletion if the user confirms affirmatively (e.g., 'y' or 'yes').

## 8. Register Command and Write Comprehensive Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7
### Description: Register the `/edit_history` command with the application's command handling system. Develop a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests covering all functionalities: listing, replacement, deletion, valid inputs, error conditions, edge cases (e.g., empty history, editing first/last item), and confirmation flows.
### Details:
Tests should verify changes to `self.conversation_history`, the output/feedback provided to the user, and correct handling of user input for confirmations. Mock dependencies as needed.
