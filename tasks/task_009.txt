# Task ID: 9
# Title: Test Advanced Multi-line Input Scenarios (Paste, Empty Submission)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Test advanced multi-line input scenarios, including pasting multi-line text from an external source and handling the submission of empty or cleared multi-line inputs.
# Details:
1. **Pasting Multi-line Text:** Copy a block of text containing multiple lines (e.g., from a text editor) to the clipboard. Paste this text into the CLI prompt. Verify it appears correctly formatted across multiple lines. 
2. **Empty/Cleared Submission:** Test submitting an input that is effectively empty: (a) Press the submission key on a completely empty prompt. (b) Type multiple lines, then delete all content, then press the submission key. The behavior should be consistent with submitting a single empty line (e.g., re-prompt, or specific handling for empty input per project design).

# Test Strategy:
1. Copy multi-line text (3+ lines) from a text editor. Paste into the CLI prompt. Verify it displays correctly. Submit and check if the full pasted text is received. 2. Without typing anything, press the submission key. Observe behavior. 3. Type several lines, then use backspace/delete keys to remove all text. Press the submission key. Observe behavior. It should be consistent with submitting a single empty line.
