# Task ID: 5
# Title: Update `/help` Command Output with Multi-line Instructions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the output of the `/help` command (if it exists) to include instructions for multi-line input, consistent with the welcome message.
# Details:
Identify the file and function responsible for generating the `/help` command's output (e.g., in `src/main.py` or `src/slashcommands.py`). Add or modify the help text to include the same multi-line input instructions provided in the welcome message (Task 4), specifically mentioning the key for newlines and the key for submission.

# Test Strategy:
Execute the `/help` command in the CLI. Review its output. Verify that it includes clear and accurate instructions for multi-line input and submission, matching the configured keys.
