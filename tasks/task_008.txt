# Task ID: 8
# Title: Perform Basic Multi-line Editing and Submission Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive testing of basic multi-line editing features such as cursor movement across lines, text insertion/deletion on different lines, and verify correct submission of the edited multi-line text.
# Details:
This task involves systematically testing the editing capabilities provided by `prompt_toolkit` in multi-line mode. Key aspects to test: 
- Moving the cursor up and down between lines using arrow keys. 
- Editing text on any line. 
- Deleting characters and entire lines. 
- Inserting new lines between existing lines. 
- Ensuring the final, edited multi-line string is submitted correctly.

# Test Strategy:
Execute the following: 1. Type 'Line 1', press `Enter`. 2. Type 'Line 3', press `Enter`. 3. Move cursor up to the line after 'Line 1'. Type 'Line 2'. 4. Move cursor to 'Line 1', edit its content. 5. Move cursor to 'Line 3', delete it. 6. Submit the input. Verify the agent receives the correctly edited multi-line string (e.g., 'Edited Line 1\nLine 2').
