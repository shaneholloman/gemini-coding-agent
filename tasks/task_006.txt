# Task ID: 6
# Title: Test Slash Command Handling with Multi-line Context
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Verify that existing slash commands (e.g., `/pdf <filename>`) continue to parse and function correctly even when entered in a multi-line input context or with accidental newlines.
# Details:
The primary goal is to ensure the input mechanism doesn't break slash command parsing. Slash commands are typically expected on a single line. Test scenarios: 
1. `/command arg` on the first line, followed by `Enter` and then other text on subsequent lines (which might be part of a prompt if the command takes multi-line arguments, or just extraneous text for testing the input mechanism). 
2. Accidental `Enter` before typing `/command arg`. 
The command processing logic itself is not expected to change, only that it correctly receives the command part of the input.

# Test Strategy:
1. Type a valid slash command (e.g., `/help`) on the first line, press `Enter`, type additional unrelated text on a second line, then submit. Verify the slash command executes correctly. 2. Press `Enter` (creating an empty first line), then type a slash command on the second line, then submit. Verify the slash command executes. 3. Type a slash command, submit. Verify it works as before.
