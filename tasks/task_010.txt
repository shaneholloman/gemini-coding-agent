# Task ID: 10
# Title: Code Review, Final Integration, and Documentation Check
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform a final code review of all changes, conduct comprehensive integration testing, and ensure all user-facing documentation (welcome message, help command) is accurate and reflects the new multi-line capabilities.
# Details:
Review all modified files (primarily `src/main.py`, potentially `src/slashcommands.py` or `src/autocomplete.py`) for code quality, correctness, and adherence to project standards. Perform end-to-end testing covering all aspects of the multi-line editing feature and its interaction with other CLI functionalities. Double-check that the welcome message and `/help` text accurately describe the multi-line input mechanism, especially the key bindings for newline and submission. Ensure no regressions in existing features.

# Test Strategy:
1. Peer code review of all related changes. 2. Execute a holistic test plan covering all test cases mentioned in the PRD (sections 5.1-5.7) and in individual tasks. 3. Verify welcome message and `/help` output for accuracy. 4. Confirm that existing features like specific slash commands, history, and general CLI stability are unaffected.
