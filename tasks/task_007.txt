# Task ID: 7
# Title: Test Autocompletion in Multi-line Input
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Confirm that the existing autocompletion functionality (for commands, file paths, etc.) remains operational and accurate within a multi-line input field.
# Details:
This task involves testing the autocompletion features, likely managed by `prompt_toolkit` and configured in `src/autocomplete.py` or `src/main.py`. `prompt_toolkit` should handle autocompletion in multi-line contexts gracefully. Test triggering autocompletion (e.g., by typing `/` or parts of commands/paths) when the cursor is on various lines of a multi-line input.

# Test Strategy:
1. Type a few lines of text. 2. Move the cursor to an appropriate position (e.g., after typing `/` or a partial command/filename). 3. Trigger autocompletion (often `Tab`). Verify that suggestions appear and can be selected correctly, irrespective of the current line number or existing text on other lines.
