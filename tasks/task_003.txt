# Task ID: 3
# Title: Verify Full Multi-line Input Reception
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure that the application's input handling logic correctly receives the complete multi-line string, with all newline characters (`\n`) preserved, when submitted by the user.
# Details:
In `src/main.py`, locate the line where user input is obtained from `session.prompt(...)` (e.g., `user_input = session.prompt(...)`). Add temporary logging or use a debugger to inspect the `user_input` variable immediately after a multi-line input is submitted. Confirm that the variable contains the full text, including `\n` characters representing the newlines typed by the user.

# Test Strategy:
Type a multi-line message like "Hello\nWorld\nTest" into the CLI. Submit it using the configured submission key. Check the application logs or debugger to verify that the received `user_input` string is exactly "Hello\nWorld\nTest" (or its equivalent with OS-specific line endings if `prompt_toolkit` normalizes, though `\n` is standard).
