# Task ID: 4
# Title: Update CLI Welcome Message with Multi-line Instructions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the initial welcome message displayed when the CLI starts to include clear instructions on how to use multi-line input, including how to create new lines and how to submit the input.
# Details:
Locate the code responsible for printing the welcome message in `src/main.py`. Modify the message string to include guidance such as: "Press Enter for a new line. Press [Submission Key Combination, e.g., Meta-Enter or Alt-Enter] to submit your message." Ensure the key combination mentioned matches the one configured in Task 2.

# Test Strategy:
Start the CLI application. Observe the welcome message. Verify that it now includes clear and accurate instructions for multi-line input and submission.
